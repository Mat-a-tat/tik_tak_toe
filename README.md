# tik_tak_toe
A simple project I made during the Udemy Python Zero to Hero bootcamp. 

Takes in player input, and allows them to create a ASCII board using the number pad. 

# Optimization: 
The below are a hoard of notes on things that I could improve / change, but would rather move to different projects for now.

  - Could be made simpler using tuples and returning them in the player sections, and numerous other areas of the program. 
  - Currently a glorious mess of dependecnies, which resulted in a overutilization of globabl variables.
  - All use in board sections could theoreticly be made more computationally efficent, but at the cost of readability (which was my priority for this project)
